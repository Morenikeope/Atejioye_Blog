Crucial to effective rural housing policy development is a supply of good quality data describing local housing conditions.\n\nIdeally, communities would have ready access to information about their local housing stock to identify needs, set priorities, and optimize allocation of resources and investments. Unfortunately, many small communities lack the capacity to systematically evaluate their housing stock.\n\nCity and county property assessors' offices seem a logical source for obtaining local housing data; however, tapping into these assessor databases poses some challenges. Access to a community's full database may be restricted, as most city and county assessors now outsource data management to private firms. Even when accessible, the database may not be amenable to custom tabulations and targeted queries about specific housing conditions. In addition, the subjectivity of the assessment process introduces biases and inconsistences into the data themselves.\n\nData science approaches including Artificial Intelligence (AI) models offer great potential for addressing these and other housing data challenges encountered by rural communities and researchers who study them. For example, image classification models could be used to rate the condition of selected exterior housing features, such as roof and siding, or to detect the presence of problems such as missing or damaged gutters or an overgrown landscape. Leveraging AI technology in this manner could streamline the housing evaluation process, eliminate subjective biases, and facilitate informed decision-making for housing investment and development initiatives in rural communities.\n\n## **Goal and Objectives**\n\nThe goal of this project is to investigate methods for conducting a thorough and objective evaluation of a community's housing stock using AI, and also to explore how such methods could be adapted for multi-community analysis of relationships between housing quality and other local attributes in rural areas.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n-   Conduct a literature review to examine examples of AI applications in planning and housing.\n\n-   identify study communities and collect data about the communities.\n\n-   Collect housing data, including images, from existing sources such as realtor websites, Google Street View and county assessor websites.\n\n-   Collect data on housing age, number of bedrooms, square footage, and assessed value.\n\n-   Utilize roof, gutter, siding, and landscape condition as part of AI analysis to identify homes that may qualify for community assistance programs.\n\n-   Assess the results and recommend next steps for Year 2 of the project, considering the insights gained and community input received.\n\n## **Literature Review**\n\nAn important objective of the project was its focus on reviewing as much accessible literature and websites. Review of how cities have been using AI to address problems, and specifically housing problems, and how counties or cities assess housing conditions. The section also answers the question, what data might we use to assess housing condition in this project?\n\n1.  **Ames City Housing Inspection**\n\nIn the context of housing inspections, the City of Ames in Iowa has implemented a comprehensive housing inspection program to ensure housing quality and safety standards are met. The Ames City Housing Inspection program focuses on various aspects of housing conditions, including grass height, weeds, trees, refuse-garbage, sidewalks, deck/porch, gutters, paint, roof, windows, structural foundation, and graffiti (City of Ames, 2021). This program serves as a valuable reference for evaluating and assessing housing quality in the rural context, particularly in the Iowa region. However, despite the efforts made by programs like the Ames City Housing Inspection, the subjective nature of evaluating existing housing conditions and the limited availability of resources for thorough investigations still pose challenges.\n\nRead more [here](https://www.cityofames.org/home/showpublisheddocument/53168/637087226539170000){target=\"_blank\"} and [here](https://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n2.  **U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development** \n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) plays a vital role in ensuring housing quality standards across the United States. In their assessment of housing quality, HUD examines various aspects of the building exterior, including the condition of the foundation, stairs, rails, porches, roof, gutters, exterior surfaces, and chimney. Additionally, HUD emphasizes the importance of evaluating lead-based paint on exterior surfaces to ensure the safety and well-being of residents. These guidelines provided by HUD serve as a valuable reference for assessing and maintaining housing quality standards, contributing to the overall improvement of housing conditions nationwide. \n\nRead more [here](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/52580A.PDF){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n3.  **Orange County Minimum Housing Code**  \n\nThe Orange County minimum housing code plays a crucial role in ensuring housing standards and safety within the county. As outlined in Section 20-34 of the code, specific requirements include the maintenance of a safe foundation, stairs, walls, roofs, and porches. The code also addresses concerns such as high weeds and dilapidated vehicles, which can impact the overall quality of housing in the area. \n\nRead more [here](https://library.municode.com/nc/orange_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIGEOR_CH20HO_ARTIIMIHOST){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n4.  **Turning Data into Equity**\n\nIn Detroit, 150 residents were tasked with surveying vacant land across the city that could be used. According to [Data-Smart City Solutions](https://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/battling-blight-four-ways-cities-are-using-data-to-address-vacant-propertie){target=\"_blank\"}, part of Harvard University, around 40,000 properties were found to be blighted and were subsequently given priority for either demolition or remediation. By involving residents in the surveying process, the city successfully identified a significant number of blighted properties, allowing for informed decision-making on demolition or remediation. Community engagement offers an avenue for prioritization, transparency, and alignment with local needs and aspirations.\n\n5.  **RoadBotics**\n\nRoadBotics has developed a technology using artificial intelligence that has the ability to analyze road imagery to then assess issues and produce cost effective solutions. This allows cities to know when and where repairs need to take place, and deal with them while saving money. This type of technology also improves safety within cities as problems will not go unnoticed. \n\nRead more [here](https://www.roadbotics.com/roadway-tutorial/){target=\"_blank\"}. \n\n6.  [Mason City](https://www.masoncityassessor.net/){target=\"_blank\"} **Assessment**\n\nAccording to Tara Brueggeman, an Assessor for Mason City, data is primarily sourced from publicly available platforms such as Beacon and the Vanguard assessment data management system. While web scraping is not feasible, city and county assessor offices can generate customized reports using SQL from Vanguard.\n\nDuring the appraisal process, appraisers rely on blueprints for property details and conduct in-person visits to measure and inspect properties. Interior inspections are now limited due to homeowner preferences, but the condition of the exterior serves as a valuable indicator. To minimize bias, appraisers adhere to guidelines outlined in the Iowa Real Property appraisal manual, avoid assessments during unfavorable personal circumstances, and undergo a review process by another individual before finalizing assessment records. These efforts contribute to the objectivity and accuracy of property assessments in Mason City.\n\n7.  **Des Moines Neighborhood Revitalization Program**\n\nThe Des Moines Revitalization program is pioneering a groundbreaking approach to assess housing conditions through the utilization of AI. With the aim of revitalizing the city's housing stock, this innovative program leverages AI technology to objectively evaluate the condition of homes in Des Moines. By analyzing various data points, including structural features, maintenance history, and overall quality, the AI system provides a comprehensive assessment of each property. This data-driven approach allows the program to identify areas in need of improvement, prioritize revitalization efforts, and allocate resources effectively.\n\nRead more [here](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/des-moines/2023/03/08/des-moines-wonders-if-a-machine-can-better-assess-home-conditions/69965121007/?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral){target=\"_blank\"} and [here](https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2023/03/10/ai-assessment-desmoines-properties-iowa){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n## Workflow\n\nThe image below depicts our project plan, outlining the strategies and actions we undertook to accomplish our objectives. The strategies include image gathering / data collection, creating a database and building AI models.\n\n![](/images/DSPG%20project%20plan.png){width=\"610\"}\n\n## Data Collection\n\nAt first, we gathered house images manually from Kaggle, amassing a total of approximately 35,000 images. However, we needed more relevant images specific to Iowa, we decided to webscrape from other sources. Through this technique, we automated the process of acquiring images. Despite this improvement, we still had to manually sift through the gathered images, distinguishing those of high quality and suitable features for training our model from those of poorer quality.\n\nBased on the WINVEST project, the team decided to work with the communities of Grundy Center, New Hampton and Independence.\n\n### Web Scraping\n\nWeb scraping is like a digital tool that automatically collects information from websites, allowing us to gather data quickly without manual searching. The image below is an example of web scraping on the Zillow website.\n\n![](/images/zillow.png)\n\nThe plan was to collect house images from the following websites;\n\n-   [**Zillow**](https://www.zillow.com/?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_content=1471764169%7C65545421228%7Caud-352785741564:kwd-570802407%7C603457706088%7C&semQue=null&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-Nv7oPL3_wIVWSazAB0eyA9CEAAYASAAEgKaafD_BwE){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    Zillow is an online platform and app for real estate that allows users to search for homes, view property listings, and access data on home values and market trends.\n\n-   [**Trulia**](https://www.trulia.com/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    Trulia is another online platform and app for real estate that helps users find homes, apartments, and other property listings, and provides information on neighborhoods and market trends.\n\n-   [**realtor.com**](https://www.realtor.com/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    Realtor.com is a website and app that offers a comprehensive database of property listings, allowing users to search for homes, apartments, and other real estate options. It also provides resources for finding real estate agents.\n\n-   **County Assessor Websites**\n\n    These are online portals provided by local government entities that offer property-related information, including property records, tax assessments, and maps. Users can access details about property ownership and tax information.\n\n-   [**Vanguard Appraisals, Inc**](https://www.iowaassessors.com/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    Vanguard Appraisals, Inc is a company that specializes in providing property appraisal services and software solutions for assessment in cities, counties and township Assessment Offices.\n\n-   [**Beacon**](https://beacon.schneidercorp.com/){target=\"_blank\"} **by Schneider Geospatial**\n\n    This is a software platform used for property assessment and tax administration. It helps government agencies manage property data, valuation processes, and tax assessments by offering geospatial mapping, data analytics, and reporting capabilities.\n\n-   **Google Street View**\n\n    To scrape images from Google Street View using the Google API, you can utilize the Google Street View Image API. You would need desired coordinates or addresses to retrieve the Street View images, and then save the images obtained from the API response to your local storage or database for further use.\n\nThe Beacon website implemented restrictions that prohibits web scraping activities on their platform. One major thing to also note is Zillow owns Trulia.\n\nWe resolved to web scraping from the following websites;\n\n-   Zillow\n-   Google Street View\n-   Vanguard\n-   Beacon\n-   Polk County Assessor Website\n\nBased on the WINVEST project, we collected house images of Independence, New Hampton, and Grundy Center. However, during the process of web scraping to gather images, we encountered the following problems;\n\n-   Blurred houses. Further investigation revealed that certain homeowners request Google to have their residences intentionally blurred on Google Street View. Such houses were ignored.\n\n-   \"Address\" inconsistencies in Independence. Some houses had multiple house numbers listed, such as 100/101, while others had addresses like 100 1/2.\n\n-   Duplicate images with different addresses.\n\n-   Particular streets are not mapped.\n\n-   Images of inside of stores showing as a house image.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](/images/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(1).png){width=\"436\"}\n\n![](/images/no_image.png){width=\"436\"}\n:::\n\n### **Address Collection**\n\n-   Address Collection and Cleaning **-** [Address Collection](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#address-collection-and-cleaning){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    ![](/images/6beacon_select.png)\n\n### Image Collection\n\n#### Scrape Google Images - [Google Image Scraping](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#scrape-google-images){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Ogden\n\nog_data <- read.csv(\"~/GitHub/Housing/complete links/ogden_urls.csv\")\n\nurls_start <- og_data[, 1]\n\nurls_full <- paste(urls_start, \"&key=\", sep = \"\")\n\nurls_full_api_key <- paste(urls_full, api_key, sep = \"\")\n\n# creates folder and downloads all images\n\ndir.create(\"ogden_google_images_folder\")\n\nfor(i in seq_along(urls_full_api_key)) {\n\n___ file_path <- file.path(\"ogden_google_images_folder\", paste0(\"G_OG_\", og_data[i,6], \"_.png\"))\n\n___ download.file(urls_full_api_key[i], file_path, mode = \"wb\")\n\n___ print(file_path)\n\n___ print(i)\n\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Creating Google API Links - [Google API](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#creating-google-api-links){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n![](/images/10use_link.png)\n\n#### Naming Convention\n\nTo ensure convenient access to the images collected from various sources, we devised a standardized naming convention: Source, City, Address.\n\n| Source       | City              |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Z - Zillow   | H - New Hampton   |\n| G - Google   | D - Independence  |\n| V - Vanguard | G - Grundy Center |\n| B - Beacon   | S - Slater        |\n| W - WINVEST  |                   |\n\n: For example,\n\n-   Zillow\n-   New Hampton, Iowa\n-   311 W Main St\n\n**Result**: Z_H_311 W MAIN ST\\_\n\n## AI Models\n\nThis section demonstrates the potential of AI to recognize the quality of house.\n\nDetails of the first attempt at creating an AI model can be found [here](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_week3/Week_Three.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n-   Building a Binary Image Classification AI Model - [Binary Image Classification](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#building-a-binary-image-classification-ai-model){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n-   Building a Multi-Category Image Classification AI Model - [Multi-Category Image Classification](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#building-a-multi-category-image-classification-ai-model){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n-   Sorting Images - [Image Sorting](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#sorting-images){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n-   Training the Model - [Model Training](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#training-the-model){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n-   Utilizing a Trained AI Model - [Utilizing AI Model](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#utilizing-a-trained-ai-model){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n-   Exporting Predictions to a CSV on Address - [Export Predictions](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#exporting-predictions-to-a-csv-on-address){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n![](/images/MicrosoftTeams-image.png){width=\"603\"}\n\n### [Guide to Housing Project AI Models](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_AI_guide_w9/AI_guide.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n![](/images/neural_network.png)\n\n### Confidence Level and Accuracy of Models\n\n![](/images/confidencelevelnew.png)\n\n## Geographic Analysis\n\nOne objective that was later included in the project was using map to display AI-model output for vegetation, siding, gutters etc. This will allow us visualize clusters or locations of houses in good conditions versus poor condition. It is also a form of spatial modeling.\n\nTo visualize addresses for the communities, first we needed to geocode (latitude and longitude) each address. Base code was from [storybench](https://www.storybench.org/geocode-csv-addresses-r/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nMore information [here](https://1angelinaevans.github.io/AngelinaEvansBlog/posts/Week6TeamBlog/Week6TeamBlog.html#mapping){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n![](/images/siding_slater.png)\n\nWe later realized we can use Tableau for better data connections and visualizations. We created a step by step process for creating a tableau dashboard showing the output from the AI Models and mapping it to the already geocoded addresses.\n\nClick [here](https://1angelinaevans.github.io/AngelinaEvansBlog/posts/MappingHouseData/MappingHouseQuality.html){target=\"_blank\"} for more information.\n\n### Tableau Dashboard\n\n![](/images/screenshot_dashboardnew.png){width=\"619\"}\n\n#### [Tableau Dashboard](https://1angelinaevans.github.io/AngelinaEvansBlog/posts/House%20Quality%20Dashboards/HouseQualityDashboard.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Demographic Analysis\n\nAfter consulting with our clients, we have selected specific attributes and demographic profiles of communities to examine.\n\nThe following characteristics were used for the demographic profile of the communities.\n\n-   Home ownership rate\n-   Population change\n-   Median household income\n-   Age of houses\n-   Median house values\n\nUsing the infographics feature on ArcGIS Pro, we created community summary of the state of Iowa, Grundy center, Independence, and New Hampton respectively.\n\n**State of Iowa**\n\n![](/images/Iowa_community_summary.png){width=\"703\"}\n\n**Grundy Center**\n\n![](/images/grundy_center_community_summary%20(1).png){width=\"703\"}\n\n**Independence**\n\n![](/images/independence_community_summary.png){width=\"703\"}\n\n**New Hampton**\n\n![](/images/new_hampton_community_summary.png){width=\"703\"}\n\nTo make a community summary infographic you can check [here](https://kailynhogan.github.io/Kailyn_Hogan_DSPG_Blog/posts/Week_7/Week_7.html#monday){target=\"_blank\"} for a guide.\n\nMore demographic analysis was done to determine which communities in Iowa could benefit from the project. We used the following indicators;\n\n-   Local spending pattern\n-   Median age of residents\n-   Population between 500 and 10,000\n-   Stable, shrinking or increasing population\n-   Presence of a school\n-   Communities with growing income base\n\nUsing TidyVerse in R, the following graphs was created.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](/images/demographics/all_population.png){width=\"498\"}\n\n![](/images/demographics/all_percent_change.png){width=\"498\"}\n\n![](/images/demographics/change_pop_cities.png){width=\"498\"}\n\n![](/images/demographics/pop_projection_cities.png){width=\"498\"}\n\n![](/images/demographics/home_ownership.png){width=\"498\"}\n\n![](/images/demographics/med_house.png){width=\"498\"}\n:::\n\n![](/images/demographics/median_income.png)\n\n![](/images/demographics/median_value.png)\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](/images/demographics/vacancy_rate.png){width=\"498\"}\n\n![](/images/demographics/vacant_reason.png){width=\"498\"}\n:::\n\n![](/images/demographics/value_and_year_built.png){width=\"522\"}\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this project successfully achieved its objectives. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to explore the implementation of AI in planning and housing, providing valuable examples and insights. Study communities within the targeted population range were identified based on specific criteria, including population stability, the presence of a school, and median age of residents. Housing data, including images, was collected from reliable sources such as Google and county assessor websites.\n\nFurthermore, the project employed AI analysis, particularly siding, vegetation and gutter detection, to identify homes that could benefit from community assistance programs. The results were assessed and used to refine the selection criteria for Year 2, incorporating the gained insights.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n-   Based on the image sources used in this project, which are Kaggle, Google Street View, Zillow, Vanguard, Beacon, County Assessor Office/websites, the best image source is **Google**.\n\n    In Year 2, utilize county assessor websites as they provide valuable data for assessment purposes and assess to Zillow, Beacon, Vanguard, and so on.\n\n-   Box is best for storing images while Github is best for storing files. Google Drive will need to separately download images and files to run. Microsoft Teams is good for general quick sharing of information but not a great home for important documents.\n\n-   **Image Classification for Model Training**\n\n    |                                                    |                                          |\n    |------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n    | **If Image Classification is ...**                 | **then we recommend ...**                |\n    | Time consuming                                     | Teamwork                                 |\n    | Subjective                                         | Obtain two ratings per photo             |\n    | Has inconsistent ratings across evaluators         | Obtain two ratings per photo             |\n    | Results influenced by number of ratings categories | Make duplicates                          |\n    | It takes up space on your local storage            | Download box on your your local computer |\n\n-   Collect more training and test house images.\n\n-   Build a broken window model to identify broken or boarded up windows and a trash model to identify trash in the yard.\n\n-   **Learning materials on DataCamp**\n\n    Deep Learning with PyTorch\n\n    Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras\n\n    Image Processing in Python\n\n    Artificial Intelligence (AI) Concepts in Python\n\n    Introduction to Web Scraping in R\n\n    Understanding machine learning\n\n-   Implement F1 Score into the code. It is a popular way to see how well models are performing.\n\n-   Tools used for geocoding were QGIS and R, use python for geocoding to check if it will be better than the two used in the project.\n\nMore objectives to be considered for Year 2 of this project;\n\n-   Could we use AI to determine which communities could benefit most from our project? If we tell it what characteristics of communities make it cause for concern, it could draw the conclusions for us and determine which communities we would want to reach out to.\n-   Create an application that can be used by cities.\n-   Leveraging spatial analysis tools, we can gain valuable insights and broaden the analytical capabilities specifically in relation to identifying communities that might benefit.\n-   Look more into how to use Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI).\n\n## Data source\n\n-   2000 - 2020 Decennial Census\n-   2021 5-Year American Community Survey\n-   Zillow\n-   Google Street View\n-   Vanguard\n-   Beacon\n-   Additional sources can be found [here](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/){target=\"_blank\"} and [here](https://data.iowa.gov/Local-Government-Finance/Taxable-Property-Values-in-Iowa-by-Tax-District-an/ig9g-pba5){target=\"_blank\"}.\n",
