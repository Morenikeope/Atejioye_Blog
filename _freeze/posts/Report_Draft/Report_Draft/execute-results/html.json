However, measuring the condition of housing in rural communities can be a complex and subjective task. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven approach that can provide a more accurate and objective evaluation of housing quality, identify financing gaps, and optimize the allocation of local, state, and federal funds to maximize community benefits.\n\nUtilizing web scraping techniques to collect images of houses from various assessor websites, an AI model can be developed to analyze and categorize housing features into good or poor quality. This can enable targeted investment strategies. It allows for the identification of houses in need of improvement and determines the areas where financial resources should be directed. By leveraging AI technology in this manner, the project seeks to streamline the housing evaluation process, eliminate subjective biases, and facilitate informed decision-making for housing investment and development initiatives in rural communities.\n\n## **Goal and Objectives**\n\nThe goal of the project is to investigate the condition of existing housing stock in rural Midwestern communities and develop a thorough and objective evaluation of housing quality using AI.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n-   Identify study communities within the population range of 500 to 10,000, focusing on stable or increasing population, the presence of a school, and median age of residents.\n\n-   Conduct a literature review to examine examples of AI applications in planning and housing.\n\n-   Collect housing data, including images, from existing sources such as Google Streets and county assessor websites.\n\n-   Collect data on housing age, number of bedrooms, square footage, and assessed value.\n\n-   Utilize roofing and gutter detection as part of AI analysis to identify homes that may qualify for community assistance programs addressing water damage issues.\n\n-   Assess the results and refine selection criteria for Year 2 of the project, considering the insights gained and community input received.\n\n## **Literature Review**\n\nAn important objective of the project was its focus on reviewing as much accessible literature and websites. Review of how cities have been using AI to address problems, and specifically housing problems, and how counties or cities assess housing conditions. The section also answers the question, what data might we use to assess housing condition in this project?\n\n1.  **Ames City Housing Inspection**\n\nIn the context of housing inspections, the City of Ames in Iowa has implemented a comprehensive housing inspection program to ensure housing quality and safety standards are met. The Ames City Housing Inspection program focuses on various aspects of housing conditions, including grass height, weeds, trees, refuse-garbage, sidewalks, deck/porch, gutters, paint, roof, windows, structural foundation, and graffiti (City of Ames, 2021). This program serves as a valuable reference for evaluating and assessing housing quality in the rural context, particularly in the Iowa region. However, despite the efforts made by programs like the Ames City Housing Inspection, the subjective nature of evaluating existing housing conditions and the limited availability of resources for thorough investigations still pose challenges.\n\nRead more [here](https://www.cityofames.org/home/showpublisheddocument/53168/637087226539170000){target=\"_blank\"} and [here](https://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n2.  **U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development** \n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) plays a vital role in ensuring housing quality standards across the United States. In their assessment of housing quality, HUD examines various aspects of the building exterior, including the condition of the foundation, stairs, rails, porches, roof, gutters, exterior surfaces, and chimney. Additionally, HUD emphasizes the importance of evaluating lead-based paint on exterior surfaces to ensure the safety and well-being of residents. These guidelines provided by HUD serve as a valuable reference for assessing and maintaining housing quality standards, contributing to the overall improvement of housing conditions nationwide. \n\nRead more [here](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/52580A.PDF){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n3.  **Orange County Minimum Housing Code**  \n\nThe Orange County minimum housing code plays a crucial role in ensuring housing standards and safety within the county. As outlined in Section 20-34 of the code, specific requirements include the maintenance of a safe foundation, stairs, walls, roofs, and porches. The code also addresses concerns such as high weeds and dilapidated vehicles, which can impact the overall quality of housing in the area. \n\nRead more [here](https://library.municode.com/nc/orange_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIGEOR_CH20HO_ARTIIMIHOST){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n4.  **Turning Data into Equity**\n\nIn Detroit, 150 residents were tasked with surveying vacant land across the city that could be used. According to [Data-Smart City Solutions](https://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/battling-blight-four-ways-cities-are-using-data-to-address-vacant-propertie){target=\"_blank\"}, part of Harvard University, around 40,000 properties were found to be blighted and were subsequently given priority for either demolition or remediation. By involving residents in the surveying process, the city successfully identified a significant number of blighted properties, allowing for informed decision-making on demolition or remediation. Community engagement offers an avenue for prioritization, transparency, and alignment with local needs and aspirations.\n\n5.  **RoadBotics**\n\nRoadBotics has developed a technology using artificial intelligence that has the ability to analyze road imagery to then assess issues and produce cost effective solutions. This allows cities to know when and where repairs need to take place, and deal with them while saving money. This type of technology also improves safety within cities as problems will not go unnoticed. \n\nRead more [here](https://www.roadbotics.com/roadway-tutorial/){target=\"_blank\"}. \n\n6.  [Mason City](https://www.masoncityassessor.net/){target=\"_blank\"} **Assessment**\n\nAccording to Tara Brueggeman, an Assessor for Mason City, data is primarily sourced from publicly available platforms such as Beacon and the Vanguard assessment data management system. While web scraping is not feasible, city and county assessor offices can generate customized reports using SQL from Vanguard.\n\nDuring the appraisal process, appraisers rely on blueprints for property details and conduct in-person visits to measure and inspect properties. Interior inspections are now limited due to homeowner preferences, but the condition of the exterior serves as a valuable indicator. To minimize bias, appraisers adhere to guidelines outlined in the Iowa Real Property appraisal manual, avoid assessments during unfavorable personal circumstances, and undergo a review process by another individual before finalizing assessment records. These efforts contribute to the objectivity and accuracy of property assessments in Mason City.\n\n7.  **Des Moines Neighborhood Revitalization Program**\n\nThe Des Moines Revitalization program is pioneering a groundbreaking approach to assess housing conditions through the utilization of AI. With the aim of revitalizing the city's housing stock, this innovative program leverages AI technology to objectively evaluate the condition of homes in Des Moines. By analyzing various data points, including structural features, maintenance history, and overall quality, the AI system provides a comprehensive assessment of each property. This data-driven approach allows the program to identify areas in need of improvement, prioritize revitalization efforts, and allocate resources effectively.\n\nRead more [here](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/des-moines/2023/03/08/des-moines-wonders-if-a-machine-can-better-assess-home-conditions/69965121007/?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral){target=\"_blank\"} and [here](https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2023/03/10/ai-assessment-desmoines-properties-iowa){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n## Demographic Analysis\n\nBased on the WINVEST project, the team decided to work with the communities of Grundy Center, New Hampton and Independence. The following characteristics were used for the demographic profile of the communities.\n\n-   Home ownership rate\n-   Population change\n-   Median household income\n-   Age of houses\n-   Median house values\n\nUsing the infographics feature on ArcGIS Pro, we created community summary of Iowa state, Grundy center, Independence, and New Hampton respectively.\n\n**Iowa State**\n\n![](/images/Iowa_community_summary.png){width=\"703\"}\n\n**Grundy Center**\n\n![](/images/grundy_center_community_summary%20(1).png){width=\"703\"}\n\n**Independence**\n\n![](/images/independence_community_summary.png){width=\"703\"}\n\n**New Hampton**\n\n![](/images/new_hampton_community_summary.png){width=\"703\"}\n\nTo make a community summary infographic you can check [here](https://kailynhogan.github.io/Kailyn_Hogan_DSPG_Blog/posts/Week_7/Week_7.html#monday){target=\"_blank\"} for a guide.\n\nMore demographic analysis was done to determine which communities in Iowa could benefit from the project. We used the following indicators;\n\n-   Local spending pattern\n-   Median age of residents\n-   Population between 500 and 10,000\n-   Stable, shrinking or increasing population\n-   Presence of a school\n-   Communities with growing income base\n\nUsing TidyVerse in R, the following graphs was created.\n\n![](/images/GPopulationChange.png){width=\"452\"}\n\n![](/images/GPopProjections.png){width=\"452\"}\n\n![](/images/GMedIncome.png){width=\"452\"}\n\n![](/images/GMedianHomeValue.png){width=\"452\"}\n\n![](/images/GMedHouseValue.png){width=\"452\"}\n\n![](/images/GMedIncome2009.png){width=\"452\"}\n\n![](/images/GYearBuilt.png){width=\"452\"}\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](/images/GPopulationChange.png){width=\"452\"}\n\n![](/images/GPopProjections.png){width=\"452\"}\n:::\n\n## Geographic Analysis\n\nOne objective that was later included in the project was using map to display AI-model output for vegetation, siding, gutters etc. This will allow us visualize clusters or locations of houses in good conditions versus poor condition. It is also a form of spatial modeling.\n\nTo visualize addresses for the communities, first we needed to geocode (latitude and longitude) each address. Base code was from [storybench](https://www.storybench.org/geocode-csv-addresses-r/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nMore information [here](https://1angelinaevans.github.io/AngelinaEvansBlog/posts/Week6TeamBlog/Week6TeamBlog.html#mapping){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n![](/images/ogden_siding_dashboard.png)\n\nWe later realized we can use Tableau for better data connections and visualizations. We created a step by step process for creating a tableau dashboard showing the output from the AI Models and mapping it to the already geocoded addresses.\n\nClick [here](https://1angelinaevans.github.io/AngelinaEvansBlog/posts/MappingHouseData/MappingHouseQuality.html){target=\"_blank\"} for more information.\n\n### Tableau Dashboard\n\n![](/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-07-06%20at%209.55.27%20PM.png)\n\n#### [Tableau Dashboard](https://1angelinaevans.github.io/AngelinaEvansBlog/posts/House%20Quality%20Dashboards/HouseQualityDashboard.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Workflow\n\nThe image below depicts our project plan, outlining the strategies and actions we undertook to accomplish our objectives. The strategies include image gathering / data collection, creating a database and building AI models.\n\n![](/images/DSPG%20project%20plan.png){width=\"610\"}\n\n## Data Collection\n\nAt first, we gathered house images through manual means, amassing a total of approximately 3000 images. However, recognizing the need for a more efficient approach to image collection, we turned to web scraping. Through this technique, we automated the process of acquiring images. Despite this improvement, we still had to manually sift through the gathered images, distinguishing those of high quality and suitable features for training our model from those of poorer quality.\n\n### Web Scraping\n\nWe planned to collect house images from the following websites;\n\n-   [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_content=1471764169|65545421228|aud-352785741564:kwd-570802407|603457706088|&semQue=null&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-Nv7oPL3_wIVWSazAB0eyA9CEAAYASAAEgKaafD_BwE)\n\n    Zillow is an online platform and app for real estate that allows users to search for homes, view property listings, and access data on home values and market trends.\n\n-   [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/)\n\n    Trulia is another online platform and app for real estate that helps users find homes, apartments, and other property listings, and provides information on neighborhoods and market trends.\n\n-   [realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/)\n\n    Realtor.com is a website and app that offers a comprehensive database of property listings, allowing users to search for homes, apartments, and other real estate options. It also provides resources for finding real estate agents.\n\n-   County Assessor Websites\n\n    These are online portals provided by local government entities that offer property-related information, including property records, tax assessments, and maps. Users can access details about property ownership and tax information.\n\n-   [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal?cmpgn=BR:PS:XXX:BR:11082021:GS:DM:BD_KeywordAdvice_EXM:RTG:Home:Home:Ad&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuueyi6aEgAMV8G5vBB36swgREAAYASAAEgKvf_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\n    Vanguard is an investment management company that offers a wide range of financial products and services. It provides investors with access to mutual funds, ETFs, stocks, bonds, and retirement accounts, focusing on low-cost investing and providing tools and resources for financial planning.\n\n-   [Beacon](https://beacon.schneidercorp.com/) by Schneider Geospatial\n\n    Beacon by Schneider Geospatial is a software platform used for property assessment and tax administration. It helps government agencies manage property data, valuation processes, and tax assessments by offering geospatial mapping, data analytics, and reporting capabilities.\n\nThe Beacon website implemented restrictions that prohibit web scraping activities on their platform. One major thing to also note is Zillow owns Trulia.\n\nWe resolved to web scraping from the following websites;\n\n-   Zillow\n-   Google Street View\n-   Vanguard\n-   Beacon\n\nBased on the WinVEST project, we collected house images of Independence, Slater, New Hampton, and Grundy Center. However, during the process of web scraping to gather images, we encountered an issue with blurred houses. Further investigation revealed that certain homeowners request Google to have their residences intentionally blurred on Google Street View.\n\n![](/images/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(1).png){width=\"436\"}\n\n### Naming Convention\n\nTo ensure convenient access to the images collected from various sources, we devised a standardized naming convention: Source, City, Address. For example,\n\n-   Zillow\n-   New Hampton, Iowa\n-   311 W Main St\n\n**Result**: Z_H_311 W MAIN ST\n\nZ - Zillow\n\nG - Google\n\nV - Vanguard\n\nB - Beacon\n\nS - Slater\n\nH - New Hampton\n\nD - Independence\n\nG - Grundy Center\n\nDuring the data collection process, we encountered \"address\" inconsistencies in Independence. Some houses had multiple house numbers listed, such as 100/101, while others had addresses like 100 1/2. Fortunately, the function used to retrieve Google images managed to run successfully, although it reported 50 errors related to these address variations, including both the dual house numbers and the presence of half signs. It is worth noting that even if one of the address numbers is removed or the 1/2 is eliminated (essentially removing the \"/\" sign), the image URL still leads to a valid Google image. In order to address this issue, it is possible to revisit the URLs and modify them to obtain images corresponding to these specific addresses, if necessary.\n\nTo learn about the web scraping techniques used for this project, click [here](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n### **Collecting Addresses and Images**\n\n-   Address Collection and Cleaning **-** [Address Collection](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#address-collection-and-cleaning){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    ![](/images/6beacon_select.png)\n\n-   Creating Google API Links - [Google API](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#creating-google-api-links){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    ![](/images/10use_link.png)\n\n-   Scrape Google Images - [Google Image Scraping](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#scrape-google-images){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n    ```         \n    {r}\n\n    # Ogden\n\n    og_data <- read.csv(\"~/GitHub/Housing/complete links/ogden_urls.csv\")\n\n    urls_start <- og_data[, 1]\n\n    urls_full <- paste(urls_start, \"&key=\", sep = \"\")\n\n    urls_full_api_key <- paste(urls_full, api_key, sep = \"\")\n\n    # creates folder and downloads all images\n\n    dir.create(\"ogden_google_images_folder\")\n\n    for(i in seq_along(urls_full_api_key)) {\n\n    ___ file_path <- file.path(\"ogden_google_images_folder\", paste0(\"G_OG_\", og_data[i,6], \"_.png\"))\n\n    ___ download.file(urls_full_api_key[i], file_path, mode = \"wb\")\n\n    ___ print(file_path)\n\n    ___ print(i)\n\n    }\n    ```\n\n## AI Models\n\nThis section demonstrates the potential of AI to recognize the quality of house.\n\n![](/images/MicrosoftTeams-image.png){width=\"603\"}\n\nDetails of the first attempt at creating an AI model can be found [here](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_week3/Week_Three.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nBuilding a Binary Image Classification AI Model - [Binary Image Classification](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#building-a-binary-image-classification-ai-model){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nBuilding a Multi-Category Image Classification AI Model - [Multi-Category Image Classification](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#building-a-multi-category-image-classification-ai-model){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nSorting Images - [Image Sorting](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#sorting-images){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nTraining the Model - [Model Training](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#training-the-model){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nUtilizing a Trained AI Model - [Utilizing AI Model](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#utilizing-a-trained-ai-model){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nExporting Predictions to a CSV on Address - [Export Predictions](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#exporting-predictions-to-a-csv-on-address){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## Recommendation\n\nSpider for web scraping\n\nMore training data\n\nGetting more images that show poor quality of housing for training data\n\n## Data source\n\n-   2000 - 2020 Decennial Census\n-   2021 5-Year American Community Survey\n-   Zillow\n-   Google Street View\n-   Vanguard\n-   Beacon\n-   Additional sources can be found [here](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/){target=\"_blank\"} and [here](https://data.iowa.gov/Local-Government-Finance/Taxable-Property-Values-in-Iowa-by-Tax-District-an/ig9g-pba5){target=\"_blank\"}.\n",
