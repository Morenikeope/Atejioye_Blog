    "text": "The absence of a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of housing quality in rural communities poses challenges in identifying financing gaps and effectively allocating resources for housing improvement. Consequently, this hinders the overall well-being and health of residents, impacts workforce stability, diminishes rural vitality, and undermines the economic growth of Iowa (not sure if it should be specific to Iowa). Moreover, the subjective nature of evaluating existing housing conditions and the limited availability of resources for thorough investigations further compound the problem. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an AI-driven approach that can provide a more accurate and objective evaluation of housing quality, identify financing gaps, and optimize the allocation of local, state, and federal funds to maximize community benefits.\nUtilizing web scraping techniques to collect images of houses from various assessor websites, an AI model can be developed to analyze and categorize housing features into good or poor quality. This can enable targeted investment strategies. It allows for the identification of houses in need of improvement and determines the areas where financial resources should be directed. By leveraging AI technology in this manner, the project seeks to streamline the housing evaluation process, eliminate subjective biases, and facilitate informed decision-making for housing investment and development initiatives in rural communities.\nThe project’s initial phase involved establishing objectives that were aimed to be achieved. These include;\n\nUsing data to find good study cities;\nLiterature review on using AI in housing and planning.\nDemonstrate the potential of AI to address housing questions;\nFocus on gutter-related issues.\n\nCan we use street view images, or photos taken by the DSPG Team?\nCan we use the photos on the assessor database/website?\n\nWhat county data are available to assess housing conditions?\n\nWhat other data might we use to assess housing conditions?\n\nIdentify where local, state and/or federal funds might be best applied.\nTools that will be useful in Year 2 and 3.\n\nOur Progress\n\nLiterature Review\n\nWe conducted research on the methodologies employed by cities and counties in evaluating housing conditions. Our research encompassed examining Ames city, Des Moines city, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Orange County, and Detroit. Additionally, we compiled research on how cities are using AI.\n\nImage Gathering / Data Collection\n\n\nZillow\nRealtors.com\nCounty Assessor Pages\n\nVanguard: Independence\nBeacon Schneider: Slater, New Hampton, and Grundy Center\nWe have obtained house images from the mentioned websites. Our focus is on four communities: Independence, Slater, New Hampton, and Grundy Center. However, during the process of web scraping to gather images, we encountered an issue with blurred houses. Further investigation revealed that certain homeowners pay Google to have their residences intentionally blurred on Google Street View.\n\nTo ensure convenient access to the images collected from various sources, we devised a standardized naming convention: Source, City, Address. For example,\n- Zillow\n- New Hampton, Iowa\n- 311 W Main St\nResult: Z_H_311 W MAIN ST_\nZ - Zillow\nG - Google\nV - Vanguard\nB - Beacon\nS - Slater\nH - New Hampton\nD - Independence\nG - Grundy Center\nDuring the data collection process, we encountered “address” inconsistencies in Independence. Some houses had multiple house numbers listed, such as 100/101, while others had addresses like 100 1/2. Fortunately, the function used to retrieve Google images managed to run successfully, although it reported 50 errors related to these address variations, including both the dual house numbers and the presence of half signs. It is worth noting that even if one of the address numbers is removed or the 1/2 is eliminated (essentially removing the “/” sign), the image URL still leads to a valid Google image. In order to address this issue, it is possible to revisit the URLs and modify them to obtain images corresponding to these specific addresses, if necessary.\n\nBuild, Train, and Test AI Models\n\n\nVegetation Model\nSiding Model\nGutter Model\n\nIn the initial stages of the project, we developed a vegetation model to gain insights before completing the housing data collection. This model utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze images and determine the presence or absence of vegetation in front of houses, providing a binary output of 0 (no vegetation) or 1 (vegetation detected).\nMoving forward, our objective is to construct additional AI models. The first model aims to identify whether a house is present in a given picture, assess if the image is obstructed by trees or cars, and determine its visibility. Additionally, this model will distinguish between images containing a single house or multiple houses.\nWe also plan to build models to address specific aspects such as vegetation, siding, and gutters. The vegetation model, which was developed earlier in the project, will be integrated to classify the level of vegetation as overgrown, maintained, or nonexistent. The siding model will assess whether the panels are broken or missing, if the paint has chipped off or faded, or if the siding is in good condition. Similarly, the gutter model will identify if the gutter is missing, damaged, or in good condition.\n\nCreate Database of Housing Information\n\n\nZillow\nRealtors.com\nCounty Assessor Pages\n\nVanguard: Independence\nBeacon Schneider: Slater, New Hampton, and Grundy Center\nCurrently, we have not established a comprehensive database to store all the data collected throughout the project. However, creating such a database would prove beneficial for the second year of the project. This centralized repository would enable efficient organization, management, and retrieval of the accumulated data, facilitating seamless access and analysis for future endeavors.\nTo summarize the task at-hand,\n\nIdentify study communities (places with population between 500 - 10,000, stable or increasing population, have a school, etc).\nCreate a database of housing information.\nSort images.\nBuild AI models.\nCompile all information in a detailed report."
