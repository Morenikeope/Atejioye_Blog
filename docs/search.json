    "text": "Crucial to Midwestern rural vitality is a supply of good quality housing for residents of all ages and income levels. Crucial to effective rural housing policy development is a supply of good quality data describing local housing conditions.\nIdeally, communities would have ready access to information about their local housing stock to identify needs, set priorities, and optimize allocation of resources and investments. Unfortunately, many small communities lack the capacity to systematically evaluate their housing stock.\nCity and county property assessors’ offices seem a logical source for obtaining local housing data; however, tapping into these assessor databases poses some challenges. Access to a community’s full database may be restricted, as most city and county assessors now outsource data management to private firms. Even when accessible, the database may not be amenable to custom tabulations and targeted queries about specific housing conditions. In addition, the subjectivity of the assessment process introduces biases and inconsistences into the data themselves.\nData science approaches including Artificial Intelligence (AI) models offer great potential for addressing these and other housing data challenges encountered by rural communities and researchers who study them. For example, image classification models could be used to rate the condition of selected exterior housing features, such as roof and siding, or to detect the presence of problems such as missing or damaged gutters or an overgrown landscape. Leveraging AI technology in this manner could streamline the housing evaluation process, eliminate subjective biases, and facilitate informed decision-making for housing investment and development initiatives in rural communities.\n\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to investigate methods for conducting a thorough and objective evaluation of a community’s housing stock using AI, and also to explore how such methods could be adapted for multi-community analysis of relationships between housing quality and other local attributes in rural areas.\nObjectives:\n\nConduct a literature review to examine examples of AI applications in planning and housing.\nidentify study communities and collect data about the communities.\nCollect housing data, including images, from existing sources such as realtor websites, Google Street View and county assessor websites.\nCollect data on housing age, number of bedrooms, square footage, and assessed value.\nUtilize roof, gutter, siding, and landscape condition as part of AI analysis to identify homes that may qualify for community assistance programs.\nAssess the results and recommend next steps for Year 2 of the project, considering the insights gained and community input received.\n\n\n\n\nAn important objective of the project was its focus on reviewing as much accessible literature and websites. Review of how cities have been using AI to address problems, and specifically housing problems, and how counties or cities assess housing conditions. The section also answers the question, what data might we use to assess housing condition in this project?\n\nAmes City Housing Inspection\n\nIn the context of housing inspections, the City of Ames in Iowa has implemented a comprehensive housing inspection program to ensure housing quality and safety standards are met. The Ames City Housing Inspection program focuses on various aspects of housing conditions, including grass height, weeds, trees, refuse-garbage, sidewalks, deck/porch, gutters, paint, roof, windows, structural foundation, and graffiti (City of Ames, 2021). This program serves as a valuable reference for evaluating and assessing housing quality in the rural context, particularly in the Iowa region. However, despite the efforts made by programs like the Ames City Housing Inspection, the subjective nature of evaluating existing housing conditions and the limited availability of resources for thorough investigations still pose challenges.\nRead more here and here.\n\nU.S Department of Housing and Urban Development \n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) plays a vital role in ensuring housing quality standards across the United States. In their assessment of housing quality, HUD examines various aspects of the building exterior, including the condition of the foundation, stairs, rails, porches, roof, gutters, exterior surfaces, and chimney. Additionally, HUD emphasizes the importance of evaluating lead-based paint on exterior surfaces to ensure the safety and well-being of residents. These guidelines provided by HUD serve as a valuable reference for assessing and maintaining housing quality standards, contributing to the overall improvement of housing conditions nationwide. \nRead more here.\n\nOrange County Minimum Housing Code  \n\nThe Orange County minimum housing code plays a crucial role in ensuring housing standards and safety within the county. As outlined in Section 20-34 of the code, specific requirements include the maintenance of a safe foundation, stairs, walls, roofs, and porches. The code also addresses concerns such as high weeds and dilapidated vehicles, which can impact the overall quality of housing in the area. \nRead more here.\n\nTurning Data into Equity\n\nIn Detroit, 150 residents were tasked with surveying vacant land across the city that could be used. According to Data-Smart City Solutions, part of Harvard University, around 40,000 properties were found to be blighted and were subsequently given priority for either demolition or remediation. By involving residents in the surveying process, the city successfully identified a significant number of blighted properties, allowing for informed decision-making on demolition or remediation. Community engagement offers an avenue for prioritization, transparency, and alignment with local needs and aspirations.\n\nRoadBotics\n\nRoadBotics has developed a technology using artificial intelligence that has the ability to analyze road imagery to then assess issues and produce cost effective solutions. This allows cities to know when and where repairs need to take place, and deal with them while saving money. This type of technology also improves safety within cities as problems will not go unnoticed. \nRead more here. \n\nMason City Assessment\n\nAccording to Tara Brueggeman, an Assessor for Mason City, data is primarily sourced from publicly available platforms such as Beacon and the Vanguard assessment data management system. While web scraping is not feasible, city and county assessor offices can generate customized reports using SQL from Vanguard.\nDuring the appraisal process, appraisers rely on blueprints for property details and conduct in-person visits to measure and inspect properties. Interior inspections are now limited due to homeowner preferences, but the condition of the exterior serves as a valuable indicator. To minimize bias, appraisers adhere to guidelines outlined in the Iowa Real Property appraisal manual, avoid assessments during unfavorable personal circumstances, and undergo a review process by another individual before finalizing assessment records. These efforts contribute to the objectivity and accuracy of property assessments in Mason City.\n\nDes Moines Neighborhood Revitalization Program\n\nThe Des Moines Revitalization program is pioneering a groundbreaking approach to assess housing conditions through the utilization of AI. With the aim of revitalizing the city’s housing stock, this innovative program leverages AI technology to objectively evaluate the condition of homes in Des Moines. By analyzing various data points, including structural features, maintenance history, and overall quality, the AI system provides a comprehensive assessment of each property. This data-driven approach allows the program to identify areas in need of improvement, prioritize revitalization efforts, and allocate resources effectively.\nRead more here and here.\n\n\n\nThe image below depicts our project plan, outlining the strategies and actions we undertook to accomplish our objectives. The strategies include image gathering / data collection, creating a database and building AI models.\n\n\n\n\nAt first, we gathered house images manually from Kaggle, amassing a total of approximately 35,000 images. However, we needed more relevant images specific to Iowa, we decided to web scrape from other sources. Through this technique, we automated the process of acquiring images. Despite this improvement, we still had to manually sift through the gathered images, distinguishing those of high quality and suitable features for training our model from those of poorer quality.\nBased on the WINVEST project, the team decided to work with the communities of Grundy Center, New Hampton and Independence.\n\n\nWeb scraping is like a digital tool that automatically collects information from websites, allowing us to gather data quickly without manual searching. The image below is an example of web scraping on the Zillow website.\n\nThe plan was to collect house images from the following websites;\n\nZillow\nZillow is an online platform and app for real estate that allows users to search for homes, view property listings, and access data on home values and market trends.\nTrulia\nTrulia is another online platform and app for real estate that helps users find homes, apartments, and other property listings, and provides information on neighborhoods and market trends.\nrealtor.com\nRealtor.com is a website and app that offers a comprehensive database of property listings, allowing users to search for homes, apartments, and other real estate options. It also provides resources for finding real estate agents.\nCounty Assessor Websites\nThese are online portals provided by local government entities that offer property-related information, including property records, tax assessments, and maps. Users can access details about property ownership and tax information.\nVanguard Appraisals, Inc\nVanguard Appraisals, Inc is a company that specializes in providing property appraisal services and software solutions for assessment in cities, counties and township Assessment Offices.\nBeacon by Schneider Geospatial\nThis is a software platform used for property assessment and tax administration. It helps government agencies manage property data, valuation processes, and tax assessments by offering geospatial mapping, data analytics, and reporting capabilities.\nGoogle Street View\nTo scrape images from Google Street View using the Google API, you can utilize the Google Street View Image API. You would need desired coordinates or addresses to retrieve the Street View images, and then save the images obtained from the API response to your local storage or database for further use.\n\nThe Beacon website implemented restrictions that prohibits web scraping activities on their platform. One major thing to also note is Zillow owns Trulia.\nWe resolved to web scraping from the following websites;\n\nZillow\nGoogle Street View\nVanguard\nBeacon\nPolk County Assessor Website\n\nBased on the WINVEST project, we collected house images of Independence, New Hampton, and Grundy Center. However, during the process of web scraping to gather images, we encountered the following problems;\n\nBlurred houses. Further investigation revealed that certain homeowners request Google to have their residences intentionally blurred on Google Street View. Such houses were ignored.\n“Address” inconsistencies in Independence. Some houses had multiple house numbers listed, such as 100/101, while others had addresses like 100 1/2.\nDuplicate images with different addresses.\nParticular streets are not mapped.\nImages of inside of stores showing as a house image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief explanation of Beacon and Vanguard as data sources.\nScraping process for Beacon.\nScraping process for Vanguard.\nData Cleaning and Challenges encountered.\nImportance of obtaining accurate and reliable data from these sources.\nLink to more information here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrape Google Images - Google Image Scraping\n\n\n# Ogden\n\nog_data &lt;- read.csv(\"~/GitHub/Housing/complete links/ogden_urls.csv\")\n\nurls_start &lt;- og_data[, 1]\n\nurls_full &lt;- paste(urls_start, \"&key=\", sep = \"\")\n\nurls_full_api_key &lt;- paste(urls_full, api_key, sep = \"\")\n\n# creates folder and downloads all images\n\ndir.create(\"ogden_google_images_folder\")\n\nfor(i in seq_along(urls_full_api_key)) {\n\n___ file_path &lt;- file.path(\"ogden_google_images_folder\", paste0(\"G_OG_\", og_data[i,6], \"_.png\"))\n\n___ download.file(urls_full_api_key[i], file_path, mode = \"wb\")\n\n___ print(file_path)\n\n___ print(i)\n\n}\n\n\nCreating Google API Links - Google API\n\n\n\nNaming Convention\n\nTo ensure convenient access to the images collected from various sources, we devised a standardized naming convention: Source_City_Address_\n\n\n\nSource\nCity\n\n\n\n\nZ - Zillow\nH - New Hampton\n\n\nG - Google\nD - Independence\n\n\nV - Vanguard\nG - Grundy Center\n\n\nB - Beacon\nS - Slater\n\n\nW - WINVEST\n\n\n\n\nFor example,\n\nZillow\nNew Hampton, Iowa\n311 W Main St\n\nResult: Z_H_311 W MAIN ST_\n\n\n\n\nThis section demonstrates the potential of AI to recognize the quality of house.\nDetails of the first AI model can be found here.\n\nBuilding a Binary Image Classification AI Model - Binary Image Classification\nBuilding a Multi-Category Image Classification AI Model - Multi-Category Image Classification\nSorting Images - Image Sorting\nTraining the Model - Model Training\nUtilizing a Trained AI Model - Utilizing AI Model\nExporting Predictions to a CSV on Address - Export Predictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping our output using GIS allows us to visualize and understand clusters for AI-model output for vegetation, siding, gutters, and roof. This will allow us visualize clusters or locations of houses in good conditions versus poor condition.\nTo visualize addresses for the communities, first we needed to geocode (latitude and longitude) each address. Base code was from storybench.\nMore information here.\n\nWe later realized we can use Tableau for better data connections and visualizations. We created a step by step process for creating a tableau dashboard showing the output from the AI Models and mapping it to the already geocoded addresses.\nClick here for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter consulting with our clients, we have selected specific attributes and demographic profiles of communities to examine.\nThe following characteristics were used for the demographic profile of the communities.\n\nHome ownership rate\nPopulation change\nMedian household income\nAge of houses\nMedian house values\n\nUsing the infographics feature on ArcGIS Pro, we created community summary of the state of Iowa, Grundy center, Independence, and New Hampton respectively.\nState of Iowa\n\nGrundy Center\n\nIndependence\n\nNew Hampton\n\nTo make a community summary infographic you can check here for a guide.\nMore demographic analysis was done to determine which communities in Iowa could benefit from the project. We used the following indicators;\n\nLocal spending pattern\nMedian age of residents\nPopulation between 500 and 10,000\nStable, shrinking or increasing population\nPresence of a school\nCommunities with growing income base\n\nUsing TidyVerse in R, the following graphs was created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, this project successfully achieved its objectives. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to explore the implementation of AI in planning and housing, providing valuable examples and insights. Study communities within the targeted population range were identified based on specific criteria, including population stability, the presence of a school, and median age of residents. Housing data, including images, was collected from reliable sources such as Google and county assessor websites.\nFurthermore, the project employed AI analysis, particularly siding, vegetation and gutter detection, to identify homes that could benefit from community assistance programs. The results were assessed and used to refine the selection criteria for Year 2, incorporating the gained insights.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the image sources used in this project, which are Kaggle, Google Street View, Zillow, Vanguard, Beacon, County Assessor Office/websites, the best image source is Google.\nIn Year 2, utilize county assessor websites as they provide valuable data for assessment purposes and assess to Zillow, Beacon, Vanguard, and so on.\nBox is best for storing images while Github is best for storing files. Google Drive will need to separately download images and files to run. Microsoft Teams is good for general quick sharing of information but not a great home for important documents.\nImage Classification for Model Training\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Image Classification is …\nthen we recommend …\n\n\nTime consuming\nTeamwork\n\n\nSubjective\nObtain two ratings per photo\n\n\nHas inconsistent ratings across evaluators\nObtain two ratings per photo\n\n\nResults influenced by number of ratings categories\nMake duplicates\n\n\nIt takes up space on your local storage\nDownload box on your your local computer\n\n\n\nCollect more training and test house images.\nBuild a broken window model to identify broken or boarded up windows and a trash model to identify trash in the yard.\nLearning materials on DataCamp\nDeep Learning with PyTorch\nIntroduction to Deep Learning with Keras\nImage Processing in Python\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) Concepts in Python\nIntroduction to Web Scraping in R\nUnderstanding machine learning\nImplement F1 Score into the code. It is a popular way to see how well models are performing.\nTools used for geocoding were QGIS and R, use python for geocoding to check if it will be better than the two used in the project.\n\nMore objectives to be considered for Year 2 of this project;\n\nCould we use AI to determine which communities could benefit most from our project? If we tell it what characteristics of communities make it cause for concern, it could draw the conclusions for us and determine which communities we would want to reach out to.\nCreate an application that can be used by cities.\nLeveraging spatial analysis tools, we can gain valuable insights and broaden the analytical capabilities specifically in relation to identifying communities that might benefit.\nLook more into how to use Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI).\nCreate a sidewalk AI model.\n\n\n\n\n\n2000 - 2020 Decennial Census\n2021 5-Year American Community Survey\nZillow\nGoogle Street View\nVanguard\nBeacon\nAdditional sources can be found here and here."

    "text": "In conclusion, this project successfully achieved its objectives. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to explore the implementation of AI in planning and housing, providing valuable examples and insights. Study communities within the targeted population range were identified based on specific criteria, including population stability, the presence of a school, and median age of residents. Housing data, including images, was collected from reliable sources such as Google and county assessor websites.\nFurthermore, the project employed AI analysis, particularly siding, vegetation and gutter detection, to identify homes that could benefit from community assistance programs. The results were assessed and used to refine the selection criteria for Year 2, incorporating the gained insights."

    "text": "The project’s initial phase involved establishing objectives that were aimed to be achieved. These include;\n\nUsing data to find good study cities;\nLiterature review on using AI in housing and planning.\nDemonstrate the potential of AI to address housing questions;\nFocus on gutter-related issues.\n\nCan we use street view images, or photos taken by the DSPG Team?\nCan we use the photos on the assessor database/website?\n\nWhat county data are available to assess housing conditions?\n\nWhat other data might we use to assess housing conditions?\n\nIdentify where local, state and/or federal funds might be best applied.\nTools that will be useful in Year 2 and 3.\n\nOur Progress\n\nLiterature Review\n\nWe conducted research on the methodologies employed by cities and counties in evaluating housing conditions. Our research encompassed examining Ames city, Des Moines city, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Orange County, and Detroit. Additionally, we compiled research on how cities are using AI.\n\nImage Gathering / Data Collection\n\n\nZillow\nRealtors.com\nCounty Assessor Pages\n\nVanguard: Independence\nBeacon Schneider: Slater, New Hampton, and Grundy Center\nWe have obtained house images from the mentioned websites. Our focus is on four communities: Independence, Slater, New Hampton, and Grundy Center. However, during the process of web scraping to gather images, we encountered an issue with blurred houses. Further investigation revealed that certain homeowners pay Google to have their residences intentionally blurred on Google Street View.\n\nTo ensure convenient access to the images collected from various sources, we devised a standardized naming convention: Source, City, Address. For example,\n- Zillow\n- New Hampton, Iowa\n- 311 W Main St\nResult: Z_H_311 W MAIN ST_\nZ - Zillow\nG - Google\nV - Vanguard\nB - Beacon\nS - Slater\nH - New Hampton\nD - Independence\nG - Grundy Center\nDuring the data collection process, we encountered “address” inconsistencies in Independence. Some houses had multiple house numbers listed, such as 100/101, while others had addresses like 100 1/2. Fortunately, the function used to retrieve Google images managed to run successfully, although it reported 50 errors related to these address variations, including both the dual house numbers and the presence of half signs. It is worth noting that even if one of the address numbers is removed or the 1/2 is eliminated (essentially removing the “/” sign), the image URL still leads to a valid Google image. In order to address this issue, it is possible to revisit the URLs and modify them to obtain images corresponding to these specific addresses, if necessary.\n\nBuild, Train, and Test AI Models\n\n\nVegetation Model\nSiding Model\nGutter Model\n\nIn the initial stages of the project, we developed a vegetation model to gain insights before completing the housing data collection. This model utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze images and determine the presence or absence of vegetation in front of houses, providing a binary output of 0 (no vegetation) or 1 (vegetation detected).\nMoving forward, our objective is to construct additional AI models. The first model aims to identify whether a house is present in a given picture, assess if the image is obstructed by trees or cars, and determine its visibility. Additionally, this model will distinguish between images containing a single house or multiple houses.\nWe also plan to build models to address specific aspects such as vegetation, siding, and gutters. The vegetation model, which was developed earlier in the project, will be integrated to classify the level of vegetation as overgrown, maintained, or nonexistent. The siding model will assess whether the panels are broken or missing, if the paint has chipped off or faded, or if the siding is in good condition. Similarly, the gutter model will identify if the gutter is missing, damaged, or in good condition.\n\nCreate Database of Housing Information\n\n\nZillow\nRealtors.com\nCounty Assessor Pages\n\nVanguard: Independence\nBeacon Schneider: Slater, New Hampton, and Grundy Center\nCurrently, we have not established a comprehensive database to store all the data collected throughout the project. However, creating such a database would prove beneficial for the second year of the project. This centralized repository would enable efficient organization, management, and retrieval of the accumulated data, facilitating seamless access and analysis for future endeavors.\nTo summarize the task at-hand,\n\nIdentify study communities (places with population between 500 - 10,000, stable or increasing population, have a school, etc).\nCreate a database of housing information.\nSort images.\nBuild AI models.\nCompile all information in a detailed report."
