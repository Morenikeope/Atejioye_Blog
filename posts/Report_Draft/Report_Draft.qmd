### **Introduction**

The absence of a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of housing quality in rural communities poses challenges in identifying financing gaps and effectively allocating resources for housing improvement. Consequently, this hinders the overall well-being and health of residents, impacts workforce stability, diminishes rural vitality, and undermines the economic growth of Iowa. Moreover, the subjective nature of evaluating existing housing conditions and the limited availability of resources for thorough investigations further compound the problem. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven approach that can provide a more accurate and objective evaluation of housing quality, identify financing gaps, and optimize the allocation of local, state, and federal funds to maximize community benefits.

Utilizing web scraping techniques to collect images of houses from various assessor websites, an AI model can be developed to analyze and categorize housing features into good or poor quality. This can enable targeted investment strategies. It allows for the identification of houses in need of improvement and determines the areas where financial resources should be directed. By leveraging AI technology in this manner, the project seeks to streamline the housing evaluation process, eliminate subjective biases, and facilitate informed decision-making for housing investment and development initiatives in rural communities.

### **Goal and Objectives**

The goal of the project is to investigate the condition of existing housing stock in rural Midwestern communities and develop a thorough and objective evaluation of housing quality using AI.

Objectives:

-   Identify study communities within the population range of 500 to 10,000, focusing on stable or increasing population, the presence of a school, and mean age of residents.

-   Explore the industries located in the communities and analyze agricultural census data to understand land ownership characteristics.

<!-- -->

-   Conduct a literature review to examine examples of AI applications in planning and housing.

-   Collect housing data, including images, from existing sources such as Google Streets and county assessor websites.

-   Collect data on housing age, number of bedrooms, square footage, and assessed value. Utilize roofing and gutter detection as part of AI analysis to identify homes that may qualify for community assistance programs addressing water damage issues.

-   Assess the results and refine selection criteria for Year 2 of the project, considering the insights gained and community input received.

### **Literature Review**

An important objective of the AI-Driven Housing Evaluation for Rural Community Development project was its focus on reviewing as much accessible literature and websites. Review of how cities have been using AI to address problems, and specifically housing problems, and how counties or cities assess housing conditions.

1.  Ames city housing inspection

In the context of housing inspections, the City of Ames in Iowa has implemented a comprehensive housing inspection program to ensure housing quality and safety standards are met. The Ames City Housing Inspection program focuses on various aspects of housing conditions, including grass height, weeds, trees, refuse-garbage, sidewalks, deck/porch, gutters, paint, roof, windows, structural foundation, and graffiti (City of Ames, 2021). This program serves as a valuable reference for evaluating and assessing housing quality in the rural context, particularly in the Iowa region. However, despite the efforts made by programs like the Ames City Housing Inspection, the subjective nature of evaluating existing housing conditions and the limited availability of resources for thorough investigations still pose challenges.
